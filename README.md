This is a training development of React Library from freeCodeCamp.org
Link of the course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org

This is the first project

Quick start:

You will need yarn or npm installed.
And I've been developing with VSCode with extension Live Server: ritwickdey.LiveServer

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```
