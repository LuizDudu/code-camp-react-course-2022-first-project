This is the first project.

## Quick start:
You will need yarn or npm installed


```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch

I've been developing in VSCode with the extensions:
Live Server: ritwickdey.LiveServer
```
